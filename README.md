# homelab
Personal Kubernetes homelab running on my old laptop. I run K3S on an Arch System.
The goal of this project is to build a realistic, modular, and Git-managed
Kubernetes environment that evolves step-by-step from a simple single-node lab
into a more complete platform (Ingress, TLS, monitoring, GitOps, etc.).
